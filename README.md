# Kernel-SS-ANOVA
Analysis of Variance of Tensor Product Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on Metric Spaces

## Notes
1. The project contains the simu_manifold_data folder holding the programs associated with the Manifolds data portion of the article in Section 7, Simulation.

2. Due to the ADNI data is too large, after compression still can not be uploaded, so for the time being will not be placed here, if readers need the data can be e-mail contact.
