# Kernel-SS-ANOVA
Analysis of Variance of Tensor Product Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on Metric Spaces

The project contains two folders, with the real_data_and_simu_happ_data holding the programs associated with the Analysis of Hippocampus Shape Data and Simulate hippocampus data portions of the article in Section 6 and Simulation in Section 7, and the simu_manifold_data folder holding the programs associated with the Manifolds data portion of the article in Section 7, Simulation.

Due to the ADNI data is too large, after compression still can not be uploaded, so for the time being will not be placed here, if readers need the data can be e-mail contact.
