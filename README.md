# Kernel-SS-ANOVA
Analysis of Variance of Tensor Product Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on Metric Spaces

## Notes
simulation_Lu.R :  Compute prediction error from the proposed method and Lu's method (Distance kernel). Table S.1 in Supplementary material.

simulation_random_represent.R:  Compute MSE  for some randomly selected representative samples across different settings.  Table S.2 in Supplementary material.

simulation_pred_runtime.R: Compute prediction errors  and computation times from the four methods: the proposed kernels, the Exponential kernel and the Laplacian kernel. Table 3 and Table 4 in the main manuscript.

Other codes: used in the 3 programs abovementioned.
